# Kristina's LeetCode|BinarySearch Solutions
This repository will contain all the LeetCode/binarysearch solutions
that I have created when facing the challenges presented
to me. The problems will be written in Python programming.
(I might add solutions written in other languages as well,
but that would most likely happen in the far future.)
It might also contain some notes that I have taken
in the process since I am re-learning data structures
and algorithms from scratch.

For those who are reviewing my code: if you have a way to
optimize any of the answers I provide, feel free to
collaborate with me. Write your solution underneath
mine and send in a pull request so I can take a look :)

Thank you! xo
